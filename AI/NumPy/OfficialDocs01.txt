GENERAL
print out the address of array
print(hex(a.__array_interface__['data'][0]))
0x1aab55565d0


Array creation
print(np.arange(0, 2, 0.3))
# [0.  0.3 0.6 0.9 1.2 1.5 1.8]

np.arange
start		=< start
stop		 < stop
step


print(np.linspace(0, 2, 9))
# [0.   0.25 0.5  0.75 1.   1.25 1.5  1.75 2.  ]
start		=< start
stop		=< stop
num


2x2 matrix
axis = 0	row
axis = 1	col


Deep copy
copy should be called after slicing if the original array is not required


Broadcasting
if all input arrays do not have the same number of dimensions a "1"
will be repeatedly prepended to the shapes of smaller arrays until
all the arrays have the same number of dimensions


# Advanced indexing and index tricks
you can use indexing with arrays as a target to assign to


REDUCE
you could implement reduce as follows

def ufunc_reduce(ufct, *vectors):
  vs = np.ix_(*vectors)
  f = ufct.identity
  for v in vs:
    r = ufct(r, v)
  return r

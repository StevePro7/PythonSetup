Marshmallow: A Sweet Python Library for Object Serialization and Deserialization

Marshmallow allows you to define schemas, which are essentially a blueprint for how data should be serialized and deserialized. You can specify the fields of an object, their types, and various validation rules.

The Marshmallow package is widely used in web development frameworks, particularly in Flask and other RESTful API implementations, to handle input validation, request/response data serialization, and database object serialization.

IMPORTANT - could not get the example in this

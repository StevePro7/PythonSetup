01. LLM		Large Language Model
Neural network trained on huge amounts of text
learns how words follow each other


02. Tokenization
AI breaks text into small pieces called tokens
Token = word, part word, symbol
more tokens = more cost = more time
i.e.
shorter prompts = faster + cheaper


03. Transformer
Brain behind LLMs
helps AI look at all words of the sentence at once using attention mechanism
i.e.
look at the relation of each word with all the others
most all modern AI models use transformers


04. Embeddings
Models understand numbers NOT text
embeddings convert text into meaning numbers
simiar words = similar meanings = similar numbers


05. Vector database
Vector DB stores embeddings
helps find similar meaning NOT exact matches
much faster than normal DBs for AI tasks


06. RAG		Retrieval Augmented Generation
Allows AI to search for data before answering
fetches relevant documents containing relevant data using embeddings


07. Hallucination
AI confidently gives wrong answers
happens when AI has no read data to rely on
RAG helps reduce hallucinations


08. Prompt engineering
How you talk to AI
clear instructions = better answers
good prompts save time + tokens


09. Fine-tuning
Training AI on your own data
generalized model learns your style / domain
used when prompts are not enough but
more control = more cost


10. Latency
How long AI takes to respond
lower  latency = faster answers
higher latency = slow and annoying


11. Agent
An AI that takes actions not just answers
can call tools, APIs, or other models
used in automation and AI workflows


12. Evaluation
Checks how good AI answers are
common methods:
* human evaluation
* BLEU / ROUGE
* BERTScore
* LLM

Model Context Protocol

LLM
Large Language Models [GPT] are powerful at generating natural language text
very good at predicting next token in sequence

BUT
they can't fetch local files, run custom code, interact with external APIs

MCP = bridge gap between language intelligence and the real world
MCP = standard to extend LLM capabilities beyond static conversations

Imagine asking your AI assistant: ‘Should I carry an umbrella today in Pune?’ — and getting back an accurate, real-time answer powered by your very own tool. That’s the magic of MCP servers

Why build an MCP server?
LLM generate content but left in isolation they lack REAL-WORLD awareness!

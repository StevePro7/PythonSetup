Vector DB = ??
Text -> embeddings -> storage -> search -> done

BUT
What’s the size of your vector database?
Is it in-memory or disk-based?
What is ANN and why not exact search?

1. What a Vector Database Really Is
Vector DB = system designed to
1. store vectors [embeddings]
2. index them efficiently
3. retrieve the most similar ones quickly


Key difference from traditional DB = how data is searched
e.g.
* similarity search
* distance-based retrieval

Example
"Find vectors closest to this query vector"
Difference changes everything


2. What Is a Vector (Embedding), Really?
An embedding is just a list of numbers.
e.g.
"I love cricket"
-> [0.021, -0.34, 0.88, ..., 0.12]

IMPORTANT
* length of this list = embedding dimension
* stored as floats	usually float32

Vector size = database size


3. What Does a Vector Database Store Internally?
A vector database does not store only vectors. It stores three things:
a. vectors	numerical embeddings
b. metadata	extra info
c. index	makes vector DB fast


ANN
Approximate Nearest Neighbor	Heart of Vector DB
find vectors that are close enough = very fast

HNSW
Hierarchical Navigable Small World
most popular ANN algorithm

Other ANN techniques
IVF	Inverted File Indes
PQ	Product Quantization
ScaNN	Google ANN

SUMMARY
Vector DB
Google Maps for embeddings
Don't check every road
Navigate intelligently

CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    vector BINARY(8)  -- Adjust size based on the vector's dimension
);


vector: The vector representation of the product  with 128 dimensions.
(e.g., from a text embedding, image embedding, etc.)


SELECT * FROM products;


INSERT INTO products (id, name, description, vector)
VALUES
(1, 'Product A', 'Description of product A', X'01020304'),
(2, 'Product B', 'Description of product B', X'12345678');


CREATE INDEX vector_idx ON products(vector);


SELECT * 
FROM products
WHERE name = 'Product A';

What is a Vector Database, Really?
A vector database stores information as vectors, not as plain text or rows. 
Each vector represents a piece of data — often a sentence, paragraph, or product description — that has been embedded into a multi-dimensional space.

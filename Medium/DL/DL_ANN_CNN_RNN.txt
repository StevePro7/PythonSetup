ANN
Artificial Neural Network
* most basic type of neural network

best for
* classification problems		spam email detection
* handwritten digit recognition
* disease prediction
* predicting house priceses

ANN
works best when data is structured
[numbers, categories]



Convolutional Neural Network
* assigned to process image + video data
* uses convolutional layers to extract features like edges

applications
* image classification			cat vs. dog
* object defection			detecting cars, people
* image segmentation			separate object from BG
* video analysis


Recurrent Neural Network
* good for sequential data where order matters
  e.g. text, speech, time-sen		unlike ANN and CNN

applications
* NLP 
* speech recognition
* time-series forecasting		stock prices, sensor data


Transformers
* replaced RNNs in modern NLP tasks
* uses attention mechanisms instead of recurrence making more powerful + scalable

famous models
BERT for classification



SUMMARY
Deep Learning Neural Networks

ANN
* Feedforward neural networks
* information processing

CNN
* harness spatial features
* convolutional layers

Transformers
* self-attention
* parallel processing

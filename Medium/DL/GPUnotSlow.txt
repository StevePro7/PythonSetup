01. CUDA Cores / Stream Processors
fundamental processing units inside GPU
nVidia	CUDA Cores 
AMD	Stream Processors

Misconception
more cores = better performance
RTX 4080 	9,728 cores 
RTX 3090 	10,496 cores

but memory bandwidth bottleneck


02. Tensor Cores - AI Accelerators
HW matrix multiplication ops
A100		6,912 CUDA cores

RTX GPUs have fewer Tensor cores than Datacenter GPUs [A100, H100]
PyTorch + TensorFlow frameworks that leverage Tensor cores


03. Memory Bandwidth - Highway to Corees
rate at which data moved between GPU memory and its processors
GB/s
memory-bound = data not fed to GPU cores fast enough = underutilized
nVidia H200	4.8TB/s
nVidia A100	2.0TB/s
RTX 4090	1.0GB/s		slow for enterprise AI

NB: if task compute bound then extra memory bandwidth won't help

Memory bandwidth = memory clock speed * memory bus width / 8
HBM [high BM] = GDDR6X, GDDR6, GDDR5


04. VRAM capacity - how much data fits
physical memory VRAM on GPU
AI LLMs need 40-80GB VRAM

nVidia H200	192GB
RTX 4090	24GB


05. Memory type - GDDR vs. HBM
GDDR	Graphics Double Data Rate
HBM	High Bandwidth Memory

HBM is faster than GDDR
often bottleneck for performance
memory bandwidth = critical to consider


06. Streaming Multiprocessors [SMs] - Organizational Units
each SM contains CUDA cores, Tensor cores, RT cores
building block for nVidial GPU architecture


07. Clock Speed - how fast each core runs
frequency at which GPU cores operator


08. Memory Bus width - Data Highway lanes
number parallel data channels between GPU cores + VRAM
measured in bits
[128-bit, 256-bit, 384-bit, 512-bit]


09. NVLink - Multi-GPU communication
NVLink = high-bandwidth interconnect = allow data quickly transferred
important in multi-GPU configurations = faster data exchange

PCIe 		 32 GB/s bandwidth
NVLink 4: 	900 GB/s between GPUs (28x faster)


10. Cache Hierarchy - Speed tiers
multiple levels of fast memory between cores to VRAM to reduce latency
registers		fastest		KB per SM
shared memory		fast		48-96KB per SM
L1 cache		fast		128KB	typical
L2 cache		slower		40-80MB
VRAM global memory	slowest		8-192GB


Real Performance formula
GPU performance = balance

Memory-bound workloads		AI training
* memory bandwidth = bottleneck
* more CUDA cores won't help
* upgrade to HBM or optimize data reuse

Compute-bound workloads		gaming, rendering
* core count and clock speed matter most
* memory bandwidth is sufficient
* focus on shader optimization

Mixed workloads			LLM inference
* tensor cores accelerate matrix ops
* memory badnwidth feeds the cores
* VRAM capacity holds the model


Bottlenecks
Q. I need more CUDA cores
A. Your memory bandwidth is the bottleneck

Q. I need more VRAM
A. Your Tensor Cores aren’t being utilized

Q. I need faster clock speeds
A. Your data isn’t even reaching the cores

Profile first!
* nVidia Nsight Compute		identifies bottlenecks
* PyTorch Profiler		shows GPU utilization
* Task Manager GPU stats	basic monitoring


SUMMARY
* CUDA/Tensor Cores:		The workers

* VRAM: 			The workspace
* Cache: 			The speed buffer
* SMs: 				The organizers
* Clock speed: 			The pace
* Bus width: 			The pipeline
* NVLink: 			The inter-GPU connector

Neurons
human brain = tiny cells
each one connects to thousands of others
sending signals + learning from patterns


Neural Network = this + maths


Each neuron
take inputs [numbers] * weights [importants] + bias [tweak] 
pass through an Activation Functions = decide what to next


LAYERS
input	layer	data	image
hidden	layer	find patterns, edges, emotions, context
output	layer 	give final result	cat OR no cat


Summary
learning by connecting and adjusting those weights
over and over


1. Activation Functions — The Brain’s Switches
if neurons added and multiplied then result = linear = boring + limited

so
activation function helps neural network learn non-linear patterns


1. ReLU	Rectified Linear Unit		most common + fast
2. Sigmoid	great for binary outputs	Yes / No
3. Softmax	used when you have multiple classes


Activation Functions
let neural networks bend reality to understand curves,
edges or emotions that aren't straight lines



2. Deep Learning = Neural Networks With Many Layers
more layers = better model becomes @ learning abstract features
shapes + meanings


CNNs
Convolutional Neural Networks
used for image recognition

RNNs
Recurrent Neural Networks
time sequences or text

Transformers
used in language models
ChatGPT, BERT, Gemini



3. Loss Function & Optimization — The Learning Cycle
neural network = prediction = how wrong was I?

Loss
loss function to measure
mean square error OR cross entropy


Optimizer
SGD
tweaks the weights to minimize that loss in the next attempt

CYCLE
predict -> calc loss -> adjust weight -> repeat


Summary
model learns from trial n' error
just like humans


4. Backpropagation — The Secret Sauce
how learning actually happens

backpropagation = calculus [chain rule]
calculate how much each weight contributed to error and adjusts it



5. Different Types of Neural Networks
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)	images
RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) 	time-based data like text, speech, or stock prices
Transformer 				powers everything from Google Translate to ChatGPT


6. Overfitting vs Underfitting
1. Overfitting
model memorizes training data but fails on new examples

2. Underfitting
model does not learn enough even from the training data


FIX
Regularization		reduce complexity
Dropout layers		ignore some neurons during training
More data!


CONCLUSION
neural networks are the foundation of AI
not magic but math and patience

AI = bunch of neurons working together making small improvements one iteration at a time

Neurons
tiny math decision-makers that work together [like brain cells] = make sense of the world


Part 1: What Are Neurons?
The tiny decision-makers powering modern AI

Neuron = tiny decision-maker

takes inputs
gives each input an importance [weight]
adds small bias
decides how "strongly" it should respond	via Activation Function


Listen to all signals -> weigh them -> make final call


Neurons good at recognizing patterns		[even if not perfect]


Neurons inspired by human brain
Artificial neuron similar but in math form

Weigh + Add step
[brain's weighing scale]

weighted sum = neuron's way of "thinking"


Activation = turning "thinking" into action
e.g.

Sigmoid		Logisting fn
Tanh		Hyperbolic tangent
ReLU		Rectified Linear Unit
Softmax		multiple choices


ReLU
energetic + fast
default for DL

Sigmoid
ideal for probabilities

Tanh
ideal for hidden layers in older networks

Softmax
pick one of many tasks


SUMMARY
A neuron takes multiple clues, weighs them, adds bias and
uses an activation to decided "how much to care"


Role of activation functions
each layer in neural network = own personality
activation function gives that personality

Hidden layers		learn patterns			ReLU or Tanh
Output layers		turns patterns into answers	Sigmoid or Softmax


Ex01 - Binary classification
hidden layer		ReLU
output layer		Sigmoid

Ex02 - Multi-class classification		Image cat, dog or horse?
hidden layer		ReLU
output layer		Softmax

Ex03 - Regression				Predict price of house
hidden layer		ReLU
output layer		Linear	[no activation]


RULE of Thumb
* ReLU			everywhere by default for hidden layers
* Sigmoid		binary		output layer
* Softmax		multi-class	output layer
* skip activation	regression	output layer


PART I
neuron = thinking unit of DL and how collection forms foundation of AI models


Part II
what a neuron is + how it learns
* forward + backward propagation	data flows thru network
* loss function				model learns from its mistakes
* optimization process			gradient descent help reduce mistakes over time
* regularization			make networks faster + scalable

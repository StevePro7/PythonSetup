Fast API BackgroundTasks

This works well for cases like:
- Sending confirmation emails
- Logging information asynchronously
- Processing uploaded files or data
- Triggering notifications or other side actions

Basic Example: Logging a Message in the Background
Ex01
pip install fastapi


Using FastAPI’s background tasks helps:
- Improve user experience: Faster responses
- Avoid blocking: Keep your server responsive even under heavy load
- Simplify code: No need to run separate workers or task queues for simple cases

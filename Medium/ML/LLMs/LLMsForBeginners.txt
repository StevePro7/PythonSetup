ML models
easy to evaluate

Yes OR No

LLM outputs = open-ended
can be partially correct

LLM evaluation = harder than any previous ML task


You are not evaluating the LLM alone.

You are evaluating:

prompt
model
context
retrieval (if RAG)
tools (if any)
user input


LLM evaluation = system-level NOT model-level


Four core dimensions of LLM evaluation

1. Relevance
Does the answer actually address the user’s question?

2. Faithfulness / Correctness
Is the answer factually correct given the context?

3. Completeness
Did the answer cover all parts of the question?

4. Helpfulness & Safety
Is the response useful, safe, and appropriate?


Accuracy = bad metri cof LLMs


Types of LLM Evaluation (Very Important)
There are three main ways to evaluate LLM systems.

1. Offline Evaluation
You evaluate on a fixed dataset.

2. Online Evaluation
You evaluate using real user behaviour.

3. Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation
Humans review:

sampled outputs
edge cases
failures


Evaluating RAG Systems (Critical Section)
RAG introduces two new failure points.

Failure 1: Retrieval Failure
Failure 2: Generation Failure


Real-world LLM evaluation
* small offline evaluation set
* automatic scoring
* human review on failures
* online feedback loop
* continuous monitoring

Evaluation = NOT a one-time task = it is a continuous process


IMPORTANT
"Did the system's behavior change and why?"


LLM evaluation is not about judging correctness
It's about detecting when and why behavior changes


SUMMARY
I built an AI system that behaves blindly

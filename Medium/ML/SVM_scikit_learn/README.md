SVM
Support Vector Machine
find optimal decision boundary that separates different categories of data
e.g.
Stock prediction


SVM
unsupervised ML algorithm to find the best decision boundary or hyperplane
to separate data points into classes
e.g.
2D Visualization


SVM
1. define decision boundary
2. maximize the margin
3. handle overlapping data


Kernel trick
technique in SVM to handle data that is not linearly separable in ints original feature space
transforms data into higher dimensional space where linear separator [hyperplane] can be found


SVM computes inner product into higher-dimensional space using kernel function

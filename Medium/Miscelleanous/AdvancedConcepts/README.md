01. Context Managers
used to manage resources e.g. files, database connection
enusre proper cleanup


02. Metaclasses
control the creation and behavior of classes
class of a class determining how classes themselves behave


03. Coroutines
allow asynchronous programming by pausing and resuming
execution using the async and await keywords


04. Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)
define a blueprint for other classes
ensuring that derived classes implement specific methods


05. Descriptors
manage the behavior of attributes and provide fine-grained
control over getting, setting, and deleting attribute values


06. Threading and Multiprocessing
used for parallel execution enabling concurrent tasks


07. Duck Typing and Polymorphism
duck typing = where the type of an object is less important
than the methods and properies it defines


08. Data classes
@dataclass is a decorator that simplifies class creation
for storing data


09. Comprehensions
allows nesting and conditional logic to comprehensions


10. Custom Iterators
allow you to control how an object is iterated over

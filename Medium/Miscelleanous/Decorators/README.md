Decorators
powerful tool in Python that modify the behavior of functions or methods
wrap another function extending its behaviour w/o permanently altering 
the original function.

Achieved using special "@" syntax


Decorators are practical application of metaprogramming


Metaprogramming
practice of writing code that manipulates other code
allows programs to treat code as data, enabling dynamic
modifications and enhancements at runtime


Decorators
exemplify how code can be manipulated dynamically
enhancing its functionality in a clean + reusuable manner


Decorator Factory
pass arguments to decorators

provide flexibility to create decorators that can be
customized with different parameters = more versatile


Multiple decorators
applied bottom up = decorator closest to function is applied first


CONCLUSION
Decorators in Python are a versatile and powerful tool
enabling us to extend the behavior of functions and methods dynamically

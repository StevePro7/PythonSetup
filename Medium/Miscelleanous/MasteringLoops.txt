List comprehension
concise way to create list by iterating over an iterable
apply optional condition or transformation


Generator expression
similar to list comprehension but produce values one at a time
using an iterator instead of creating entire list in memory


map()
function applies a specified function to each item in an iterable


filter()
extract elements based on a condition without writing a full loop



reduce()		functools
applies a function cumulatively to the items of an iterable
reducing it to a single value



itertools		module
provides a collection of tools for creating and manipulating iterators
including infinite sequences, combinations, and permutations



Set and Dictionary comprehensions
allow you to create sets and dictionaries in a concise manner



Asyncio			concurrent tasks
handles asynchronous programming allowing tasks to run concurrently
instead of sequentially

I/O bound tasks like API calls or database operations

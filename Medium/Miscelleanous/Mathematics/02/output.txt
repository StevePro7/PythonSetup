Convexity
function = convex iff line segment btwn any 2x points lies above graph

Ex01
Convex vs. Non-Convex Functions


Ex02
Convex Surface
Convex Contours: single basin
Gradient Descent Paths on Convex Landscape


Ex03
Saddle Surface
Saddle Contours: ascent in one directions, descent in another


Ex04
Non-Convex Surface: Himmelblau's Function
Non-Convex Contours: multiple basins
Gradient Descent Paths on Non-Convex Landscape (Himmelblau)


Ex05
Gradient Vectors Point to Steepest Ascent


Ex06
Function Velocity (slope) and Acceleration (curvature) Analogy


Ex07
Convex Surface with Positive Definite Hessian
Contour Lines Showing Convex Shape


Ex08
Accuracy: 0.9736842105263158
Log Loss: 0.060019464522388176


Ex09
Convex Loss Visualization
Convex Loss Curve for Logistic Regression


Ex10
Convex model [Softmax]
Run this program with warnings Tensorflow Could not load dynamic library

This means TensorFlow itself cannot find compatible CUDA libraries or drivers at runtime, even if they are installed on the system

python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
[]

Train ML omdel
goal: minimize loss function

loss function
math expression that measures how far the model predictions are from the actual outcomes

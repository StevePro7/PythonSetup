Metaclass
class for classes


create normal class Python internally creates a meta class
e.g.
MyClass = type("MyClass", (), {})

type
class creator

type = metaclass


If we want to control how our classes are created then we must use custom metaclasses


EXAMPLE
__new__
constructor of the metaclass
modified the class even before it's created


Modify the metaclass to force all the models to have a specific method
e.g.
save()


If save() method is not specified then the code will throw a TypeError


Now developer has full control over the class structure
even before the code executes

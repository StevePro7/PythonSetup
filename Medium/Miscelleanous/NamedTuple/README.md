Stop Using Boring Tuples: Try Pythonâ€™s namedtuple() Instead

user = (1, 'Aliyan', 22)

NamedTuple
factory function in Python that comes from the collections module
lets you create a new data type with named fields that behaves like regular tuple
but is more readable and self-documenting


IMPORTANT
Do this:
user = user._replace(age=27)

Not this:
user.age = 23


Field names must be valid identifiers
Order matters


SUMMARY
Next time you reach for a tuple or dictionary think
Could a NamedTuple make this cleaner?   YES!

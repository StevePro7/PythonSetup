1. Use Built-In Libraries and Functions
Python built-in libraries and functions implemented in C
e.g.
sum()
map()
filter()

Use sum() instead of manual loops for summing a list.
Use map() and filter() instead of list comprehensions where applicable.
        

2. Optimize Data Structures
Use sets for membership checks.
Use dictionaries for key-value lookups.
Use NumPy arrays instead of lists for numerical data.


3. Use NumPy or Pandas for Data Processing
NumPy and Pandas leverage optimized C routines


4. Leverage Multithreading or Multiprocessing
Use the concurrent.futures or multiprocessing modules to parallelize tasks


5. Use Cython or PyPy
CPython (the default Python interpreter)
PyPy: A JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler for Python that can significantly speed up runtime.


6. Avoid Redundant Calculations
Memoization is a technique used to optimize the performance of algorithms by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing those results when the same inputs occur again.
e.g.
functools.lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)  # This decorator caches the results of fib(n)
def fib(n):


7. Profile and Identify Bottlenecks
Use cProfile or timeit to identify slow parts of the code.

import cProfile
cProfile.run('your_function()')


8. Optimize Loops
Combine loops or use list comprehensions where appropriate


9. Use Libraries for Heavy Computations
Libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch are optimized for tasks involving large-scale matrix computations.


10. Move Critical Code to C/C++
Use libraries like ctypes or cffi to integrate C/C++ code with Python.

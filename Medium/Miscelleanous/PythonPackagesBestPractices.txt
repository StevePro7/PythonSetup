Build + distribute Python package

Packaging means
building a Python package		source code
distributing the Python package	publish package


NB:
use pyproject.toml based builds for Python packages
with more complicated needs


Python package
bundles of Python code that can be distributed to other people
installed by a tool like pip


TWO types of Python packages


01. Source packages	tar.gz
snapshot of the source code with a manifest file
that includes metadata like Name, Version, Summary, Author


02. Wheel packages	whl
an improvement on the Egg format and now the most
recommended format


DIFFERENCES

01. Source packages	tar.gz
SOURCE DISTRIBUTION
contains only source code
extensions compiled on User side
Metadata stored in <package-name>.egg-info
created with sdist option
tar.gz	file


02. Wheel packages	whl
BINARY DISTRIBUTION
contains source code + pre-built extensions
extensions compiled on Developer side
Metadata stored in <package-name>.dist-info
created with bdist_wheel option
whl	file


Building standards

01. "old" standards
setup.py
setup.cfg
setuptools

02. "new" standards
pyproject.toml based packaging


IMPORTANT
article goes into great depth on why you should not build packages
using the "old" standards


PEP 517
Backend
program that reads your pyproject.toml and actually does the work of
turning your source code into a package archive that can be installed
or distributed.
e.g.
setuptools, poetry-core, hatchling, pdm-backend, flit-core


Frontend
use interface (usually CLI) that calls the backend
e.g.
pip, build, poetry, hatch, pdf, flit


SUMMARY
- declare build backend in the [build-system] table of your project.toml file
- declare your project metadata in the [project] table of your project.toml file

Choose backend
- pick any backend that supports PEP 517 and PEP 621

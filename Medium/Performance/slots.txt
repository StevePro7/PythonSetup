01. Use __slots__ to reduce memory overhead in classes
BEFORE
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, id, species, locations):
        self.id = id
        self.species = species
        self.locations = locations  # List of GPS tuples

AFTER
class Animal:
    __slots__ = =['id', 'species', 'locations']
    def __init__(self, id, species, locations):
        self.id = id
        self.species = species
        self.locations = locations  # List of GPS tuples


Each instance of Animal had a dynamic attribute dictionary which wastes memory
esp. when you have thousands of objects


__slots__
helps reduce memory overhead by preventing the creation of a per-instance __dict__

i.e.
does not have __dict__
thus uses less memory esp. when you have many [millions] instances

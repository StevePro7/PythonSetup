01. lru_cache
Function caching
store results of expensive or frequently called function calls and cache result
improve performance of functions called repeated w/ same args reducing unnecc computation
e.g.
functools.lru_cache
LRU
Least Recently Used retain most recent results and discard oldest ones


02. pydantic
Pydantic settins module provides clean + efficient way to handle configurations
by auto load + validate settings from environment variables .env files or default values
e.g.
pip install -q pydantic-settings


03. Descriptors
Descriptors are powerful feature in Python that allow customization of attribute
access.  Descriptor can be used for validation, cahcing or lazy loading

A descriptor is an object that implements one or more methods
__get__()
__set__()
__delete__()

which manage the behavior of attribute access

Descriptors can be used to define properties, manage access control and
enforce constraints on class attributes

Understanding descriptors can help you write more flexible and maintainable
object-orientated code in Python


04. Pickling and Unpickling
Pickling    process of serializing Python object into byte stream saved to file
Unpickling  reverse process byte stream is converted back into Python object

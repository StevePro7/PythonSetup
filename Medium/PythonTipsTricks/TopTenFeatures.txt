01. functools.cache
memoization
CLIs, ETL jobs, batch scripts


02. typing.Protocol
function depends on behavior not inheritance
structural typing - similar to interface??


03. dataclasses.replace
replace gives dataclasses immutability without ceremony
instead of mutating you get a new object while old one stays untouched


04. itertools.pairwise
replace manually index into a list to compare adjacent elements


05. assignment expressions [:=]
walrus operator
helps stream or parse loops where you'd otherwise duplicate work


06. pathlib
replaces os.path, os.listdir etc.
paths become objects which have methods


07. contextlib.suppress
cleaner than try-except-pass for things you don't care if they fail
e.g.
delete temp file


08. contextvars
replace passing IDs through async code
globals don't work neither do thread locals
async task gets its own logical context
set a value once and read it anywhere downstream


09. match with guards
replace large if-else chains
match with guards help express intent


10. contextlib.ExitStack
when managing a dynamic number of resources
ExitStack lets you enter an unknown number of context managers
and guarantees cleanup
no half-open resources when something fails mid-way

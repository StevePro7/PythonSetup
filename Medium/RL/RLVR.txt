RL
relied on explicit human feedback or learned reward models to train agents


RLVR
Verifiable Rewards
training paradigm powering reasoning models = next gen problem solving AI

Instead of guessing what humans prefer RLVR uses deterministic
rule-based signals to tell models when they are correct

Problem: reward models = neural networks = they hallucinate!

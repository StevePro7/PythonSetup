Reinforcement Learning
type of machine learning where system [agent] learns by
interacting with an environment


Agent
- takes an action
- gets feedback		[reward or penaly]
- learns what works
- tries again


Terminology

1. Agent
learner or decision-maker
e.g.
robot
game player
trading bot


2. Environment
world the agent lives in
e.g.
game screen
road
stock market


3. State
current situation
e.g.
player position
speed
score


4. Action
what the agent can do
e.g.
move left
buy stock
accelerate


5. Reward
feedback from environment
e.g.
+1 wining
-1 losing


6. Policy
strategy for choosing actions
e.g.
if enemy is near then run



7. Value function
how good a state is in long-term rewards



Real-world applications
1. Game AI
2. Robotics
3. Self-driving cars
4. Trading bots
5. Industrial systems


RL Algorithms
1. Q-Learning		learns how good an action is
2. SARSA		similar to Q-Learning but uses current policy
3. DQN			Deep Q Network	use neural networks
4. Policy Gradients	directly improves the policy instead of values
5. Actor-Critic		one part decides actions another evaluates


Rewards define everything!


Typical RL loop
1. observe current state
2. choose an action
3. perform action
4. receive reward and next state
5. update policy or values
6. repeat


RL challenges
* exploration vs. exploitation
* rewards delayed
* sparse rewards = learning slow
* high computation cost
* training takes time + patience


RL libraries
* Open AI Gym
* Stable-Baselines3
* RLlib
* TensorFlow agents
* PyTorch RL tools


Summary
RL not about perfection but learning from mistakes

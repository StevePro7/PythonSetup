Step 4: Setting Up KinD (Kubernetes in Docker) Cluster
KinD (Kubernetes in Docker) is a tool for running Kubernetes clusters in Docker containers. We'll use KinD to run a local Kubernetes cluster and deploy our RabbitMQ and consumer services to it.

Install KinD (if not already installed)
If you donâ€™t have KinD installed, you can follow the installation instructions here: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/.

Create a KinD Cluster
Run the following command to create a local KinD cluster:
kind create cluster --name rabbitmq-cluster


This will create a local Kubernetes cluster in Docker.

Deploy the Services to KinD
Create Kubernetes Deployments for RabbitMQ and Consumer:

We will create Kubernetes YAML files for RabbitMQ and the consumer application.

rabbitmq-deployment.yml



Apply the Deployments:

Run the following commands to deploy RabbitMQ and the consumer to the KinD cluster:

bash
Copy
kubectl apply -f rabbitmq-deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f consumer-deployment.yml

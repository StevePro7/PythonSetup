Step 5: Test the Multithreading
To test if multithreading is working properly:

Verify Logs of the Consumer: After deploying the consumer, you can check the logs to see if multiple threads are processing messages concurrently.


Look for output indicating multiple threads processing messages at the same time (i.e., "Processed message" for multiple messages concurrently).

Send Some Test Messages to RabbitMQ:

Use the RabbitMQ management UI to send messages or use the pika library in Python to publish some test messages to the my_queue queue.

Example to send messages (you can run this in a Python script or directly from the Python REPL):


Monitor the Consumer: Check the logs and see if multiple messages are processed concurrently by the consumer.

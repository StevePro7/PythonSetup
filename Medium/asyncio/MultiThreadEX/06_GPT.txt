Step 6: Clean Up
Once you're done testing, you can clean up your Kubernetes cluster by running:


Conclusion
In this setup, we:

Created a RabbitMQ consumer using ThreadPoolExecutor to handle multiple concurrent connections.

Containerized the consumer and RabbitMQ service using Docker.

Used KinD to deploy RabbitMQ and the consumer in a local Kubernetes cluster.

Tested multithreading by verifying concurrent message processing in the consumer logs.

This should give you a good starting point for running a multithreaded RabbitMQ consumer within a Kubernetes environment using Docker.

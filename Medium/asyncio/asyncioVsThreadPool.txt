- ThreadPoolExecutor
- asyncio


ThreadPoolExecutor
run existing sync code thru pool of threads
specify max threads to be run
thread creation + context switching = overhead


asyncio
designed for I/O-bound tasks
runs in a single thread with event loop
schedules execution based on async / await = concurrency
no thread creation or clean up


I/O-Bound Tasks
asyncio			high concurrency
ThreadPoolExecutor	sync code

CPU-Bound Tasks
Neither
Why?
asyncio			runs in a single thread
ThreadPoolExecutor	GIL constraint

Throttling
asyncio			must implement your own
ThreadPoolExecutor	built-in capability

Legacy Code Integration
asyncio			N/A
ThreadPoolExecutor	always

High-Concurrency Network apps
asyncio			always
ThreadPoolExecutor	N/A	inefficient thread overhead

Error Handling + Structured Concurrency
asyncio			better + easier via TaskGroup
ThreadPoolExecutor	does not have structured concurrency

Shared Memory
asyncio			better with asyncio.Queue
ThreadPoolExecutor	not mentioned


SUMMARY
asyncio			high-concurrency I/O-bound tasks + new code
ThreadPoolExecutor	synchronous I/O-bound tasks or legacy code

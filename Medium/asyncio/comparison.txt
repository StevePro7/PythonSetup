In Python if asycnio is good for I/O-bound tasks then what type of tasks are better suited for threads and multithreading in Python

01.
aysncio		[asynchronous programming]
best for I/O-bound tasks that spend a lot of time waiting
e.g.
waiting for network responses, file or database access

Why?
because asyncio is single-threaded and works best when you're doing many tasks that are "paused" often (e.g. waiting for a response) - it lets other code run while waiting


02.
Multithreading
best for I/O-bound tasks esp. working with blocking libraries that aren't async-aware
e.g.
requests

Why?
Python [OS] threads can help overlap I/O operations.  Even though Python has the Global Interpreter Lock [GIL] it doesn't affect I/O-waiting threads as much.  

So it's still effective for I/O-bound workloads just not CPU-heavy ones


03.
Multiprocessing
best for CPU-bound tasks that need serious computation
e.g.
ML model training

Why?
the GIL becomes a bottleneck for CPU-heavy tasks in threads but multiprocessing runs each process inits own Python interpreter so it bypasses the GIL


SUMMARY
I/O-bound	asyncio		Great when using async-aware libraries	[aiohttp, asyncpg]
I/O-bound	multithreading	Great when using blocking libraries	[requests]
CPU-bound	multiprocessing	Needed to avoid GIL and use multiple cores

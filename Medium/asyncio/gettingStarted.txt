Coroutine
async def function
- function capable of pausing and resuming
- co-operative function which yields the control back to event loop


Event Loop	
entry point of the aqsync programs
asyncio.run() 
function responsible to manage the event loop for our program

asyncio.run() 
- creates an event loop for a program
- schedules the main routine [ the function that we pass as a parameter to asyncio.run() ]
- runs the event loop until the main task completes
- closes the event loop


ISSUES

Multiple concurrent event loops
Missing await with async function calls

Blocking the event loop
as coroutine runs in the event loop thread - if a blocking function [time.sleep()]
is called inside the coroutine then it results in block the event loop thread
no other coroutines are executed until the completion of that blocking function


DEBUGGING asyncio
pass debug=True in asyncio.run
e.g.
asyncio.run(main(), debug=True)

i.e.
executing in the event loop without yielding control back to the event loop

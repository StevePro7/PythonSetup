Course Overview
Hi everyone. My name is Robert Smallshire. Welcome to our course, Advanced Python. I'm a principle consultant at Sixty North, and out of the dozen or so programming languages I can choose to use, Python is the one I return to again and again to produce low friction solutions quickly and efficiently. I've been working regularly with Python since the turn of the millennium, using it to solve problems across a wide range of business, scientific, and engineering sectors ranging from simulating geological processes in planet Earth through to monitoring and controlling electricity consumption in industrial plants over the web. Over that time Python has exploded in popularity from being an obscure scripting language to becoming one of the most popular and widely used language in the world. The growing demand for Python skills reflects it's broad adoption in the diverse realms of web development, data science, cloud operations, and as an embedded scripting language in professional applications. This course is the culmination of our series on the core Python language. We'll cover advanced topics, a knowledge of which will set you apart from the greater number of Python developers. Topics, such as descriptors, we'll learn how to gain fine grain control over attribute access, metaclasses, where you'll see how to intercept class object construction, and virtual subclasses, where you'll discover the subtle but powerful controls Python gives you over class relationships. By the end of this course you'll know enough Python to understand the advanced techniques used to implement sophisticated frameworks, like SQLAlchemy or Django, and be able to bring those capabilities to bear in your own solutions. Before beginning this course you should be familiar with the material we cover in our Python Fundamentals and Python Beyond the Basics courses here on Pluralsight. I hope you'll join me on this journey to expand your core Python 3 language skills with the advanced Python course at Pluralsight.

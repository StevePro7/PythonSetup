Byte-oriented Programming
Everything Is Bits and Bytes
Hello. My name is Robert Smallshire. Welcome to the second module of the Advanced Python course. In this module we'll be going low level to look at byte-oriented programming in Python. At the bottom everything is bits and bytes and sometimes it's necessary to work at this level, particularly when you're dealing with binary or non-text data from other sources. Remember that in Python 3, although not in Python 2, there is a very clear separation between texts, which is stored in the Unicode capable str type and raw bytes, which are stored in the aptly named bytes type. Specifically in this module, we are going to review the bitwise operators, look at the binary representation of integers, fill in some additional details about the bytes type, introduce the bytearray type, look at packing and unpacking binary data with the struct module from the Python standard library, look at memoryview objects, and show how to use memory-mapped files.

Method Resolution with Virtual Base Classes
It's worth bearing in mind that unlike regular base classes, virtual base classes don't play a role in method resolution. We'll demonstrate this by adding a thrust method to the Sword virtual base class. Now let's create an instance of broad_sword. Invoking swipe on broad_sword works as expected. Attempts to invoke thrust on subclasses raise an attribute error, and checking further, we can see that sword is not present in the method resolution order for BroadSword. For this reason, it is not possible to call virtual base class methods using super, which relies on searching the mro.

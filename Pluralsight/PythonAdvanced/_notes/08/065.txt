Virtual Subclass Registration
It's also possible to directly register a class as a virtual subclass with an abstract base class whose metaclass is ABCMeta using the register metamethod. For example, let's create an abstract base class Text, and register the built-in type, str, as a virtual subclass. Notice that the register metamethod returns the class which was registered, a point we'll return to in a moment. Now we can even retrofit base classes to the built-in types albeit virtual bases. Here we demonstrate that the built-in str class is now considered a subclass of our text class defined at the REPL, and string objects are instances of Text. Because the register metamethod returns it's argument we can even use it as a class decorator. Let's register a class, Prose, as a virtual subclass of Text.

Differences btwn unittest Mock and MaginMock?

Mock
most basic mock object
used to simulate an object that you can configure and assert during testing
allows you to mock methods and attributes
BUT
does not come with any special behavior by default
[like magic methods]


MagicMock
subclass of Mock and provides additional functionality
e.g. 
magic methods
__getitem__
__setitem__
__iter__ 
__call__
__enter__
__exit__
these are special methods in Python that enable objects to interact with language features like:
iteration,
context management	[with statements]
function calling

when you use MagicMock you get support for magic methods
if you need a mock object to behave like a more complex object
e.g.
iterable,
callable,
context management
then MagicMock is a better choice

REpresentational State Transfer

architecture of the World Wide Web
defines set of constraints for how architecture of Internet scale distributed system e.g. WWW should be behave

emphasizes scalability btwn components, uniform interfaces, independent deployment of components,
creation of layered architecture for caching components to reduce latency


RESTFUL
web service must adhere to 6x principles:

1.	uniform interface
2.	stateless
3.	cacheable
4.	client-server
5.	layered system
6.	code on demand


Statelessness
every packet sent / recd is understood in isolation from previous packets
high volume apps, increase performance by remove server session info retention

Cacheability
cache responses to improve performance and scalability

Layered system
client can't tell if connected directly to server or via intermediary like proxy server [reverse] or load balancer

Code on demand
client side scripting

Uniform interface
decouples architecture so each part evolve independently
- resource identification in requests
- resource manipulation thru representations
- self-descriptive messages
- Hypermedia	HATEOAS	Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State	response provide further info e.g. links


Richardson REST maturity model
0	define URI	e.g. POST
1	create separate URI for individual resources
2	use HTTP methods to define operations on resources
3	use Hypermedia

01.
What modules are installed / setup by default?
python
help('modules')


02.
Q: What does the __init__.py file do?
A: I said initialization and configuration of Python when setup and launch
__init__.py file is used to distinguish a Python package as a directory of Python modules
as opposed to simply a directory of Python scripts


03.
Q: What is list comprehension and have you ever used it?
A: List comprehension is "Pythonic" syntax and optimization of standard for-loop
list comprehension offers shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on values from an existing list


04.
Q: What is map in Python?
A: I said it defined key values as seen in a dicitonary
   Really it "maps" arguments" to functions
   OR maps values to functions thus you can use to lookup function mapping


05.
Q: What is the difference between tuple and list?
A: I remembered using tuple when scripting game engine using Python (in Game Scripting Mastery book)
   But really better answer is tuples are immutable whereas list are mutable (and can be changed)
difference is mutability
list	mutable
tuple	immutable


06.
Q: What is the global variable? lock
A: I suggested it's lock for global variables when used in multi-threaded applications
   But Python is single-threaded; I don't really remember what this is for...??
GIL
Global Interpreter Lock
Python GIL is a mutex [lock] that allows only one thread to hold the control of the Python interpreter

Ginger used for the JavaScript and Async web services

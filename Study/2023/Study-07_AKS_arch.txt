MS architecture style for building applications that are resilient, highly scalable + independently deployable


https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-difference-between-azure-load-balancer-gateway-memon

Load Balancer
distributes traffic across VMs at the Transport layer [L4]

Application Gateway
manages + optimizes HTTPS traffic at Application layer [L7]

AGIC
Application Gateway Ingress Controller
AKS resource leverages Azure native Application Gateway [L7]

API Gateway	via Azure API Management service
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62364877/what-is-the-difference-between-api-gateway-provided-by-azure-api-management-and
Facade for APIs: transform incoming / outgoing requests
BFF	Backend For Frontend	acts as Reverse Proxy

API gateway in Kubernetes handled by Ingress controller


https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks-microservices/aks-microservices

K8s service
static IP address for group of pods [Replicaset]
mapping endpoint IP addresses + ports done by kube-proxy

kube-proxy = worker node K8s network proxy


INGRESS
aggregate multiple requests into single request to reduce chatiness


Encryption
Prod = signed certificates from trusted CA certificate authority e.g. Let's Encrypt
NB: rotate certificates


Bulkhead pattern
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/bulkhead

application design to be fault tolerant
applicaiton isolated into pools so if one fails the others will continue to function
named after partitions [bulkhead] of a ship hull


SECURITY
rbac

Service principal
service identity used by applications

Role		set of permissions
RoleBinding	assign users or group to role	


Secrets mgt
Managed identity
application or service has a service principal created in MS Entra ID + authenticates using OAuth 2.0 tokens

process code transparently get token = don't need to store password or connection strings

BUT
not all Azure services use managed identities

other options
Azure Key Vault
mount secrets from Key Vault as volume
volume reads secrets from Key Vault


Container security
threat + vulnerability monitoring
automate image patching
store images in trusted private registry
apply principle of least privilege

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ie/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks/baseline-aks

Access cluster secrets
use Secrets store CSI driver	Container Storage Interface
Azure Key Vault with Secrets Store CSI Driver using the add-on to retrieve the TLS certificate from the key vault


Node and pod sacalability
HPA	Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
Kubernetes can scale out by adding more pods to existing nodes

Autoscaling
when additional pods can no longer be scheduled then the number of nodes must be increased in AKS cluster


HPA
K8s resource that auto scales the number of pods by setting the min / max replica count
e.g.
kubectl autoscale rs foo --min=2 --max=5 --cpu-percent=80
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale

RS	replicaset
group of pods

Cluster autoscaler
AKS add-on component that scales the number of nodes in a node pool
e.g.
az aks create --enable-cluster-autoscaler
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cluster-autoscaler?tabs=azure-cli


Azure Monitor
recommended tool to monitor performance of container workloads: view events in realtime


Self-healing
monitor health of pods: set Liveness + Readiness probes
if pod is unresponsive then K8s with restart pod

Liveness	determines if pod is healthy	
Readiness 	determines if pod is ready to receive requests / traffic



SUBNET
https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/subnet
segmented piece of larger network
Orgs use subnet to divide large network into smaller more efficient sub networks
grouping smaller interconnected networks help minimize traffic: traffic doesn't have to flow thru unnecessary routers
[increasing network speeds]


Advanced Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) microservices architecture
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks-microservices/aks-microservices-advanced

CSI provider
gets secrets stored in Azure Key Vault and uses the Secret Store CSI driver interface to mount them into Kubernetes pods

Flux
CD solution for K8s powered by GitOps


AGIC
Application Gateway Ingress Controller
API Gateway routing = reverse proxy that routes requests from clients to microservices
Kubernetes ingress resource + ingress controller handle most API gateway functionality
- aggregate multiple requests
- offload SSL termination, rate limit etc.


Network Policy
zero-trust
restrict pods that allowed to communicate with each other + other network endpoints


Resource quotas
CPU
memory


Cluster autoscaling
scales the number of nodes

Pod autoscaling
HPA	horizontal pod autoscaling
scales pods beased on CPU, memory
specify min/max number of replicas in K8s deployment pod spec


Health probes
liveness
readiness


Monitoring
APM	Application Performance Monitoring
detect anomalies, diagnosing issues, understand dependencies between services

Application Insights
- logs HTTP requests, latency, result code
- enable distributed tracing


Security
- AKS workload identity	= managed identity
- ARM => OAuth 2.0 tokens = no passwords OR connection strings
- assign identities to services that require them
- K8s API access => appliation pods configured to use service account
- Azure Key Vault: provides centralized mgt access control for keys/secrets not available in MS Entra
- AKS mount secrets from Key Vault as a volume: pod can read Key Vault secret like regular volume via CSI

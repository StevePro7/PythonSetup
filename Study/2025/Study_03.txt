Data scientists and machine learning engineers write terrible Python code that does not confirm to classic Software Engineering best practices - I am a Senior Software Engineer with 20yrs professional experience - what can I do to improve their Python code quality?


1. Introduce Code Reviews with Clear Expectations
* Naming conventions
* Function size and purity
* No hardcoded paths / constants
* Test coverage
* Type hints (where reasonable)

2. Promote Use of Tools That Enforce Quality Automatically
black  # auto-formatting
flake8 # linting
mypy   # static type checking
isort  # import sorting

pre-commit hooks or CI pipeline
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

3. Move Prototypes from Jupyter to Modules
4. Introduce Testing Gradually
5. Introduce Dependency and Environment Management

6. Refactor for Reusability and Separation of Concerns
Introduce a pipeline structure: input → preprocess → model → output.

7. Mentor & Pair Program
8. Advocate for a MLOps Culture
Promote infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi), and model deployment frameworks (e.g., FastAPI + Docker, BentoML, Seldon Core).

Offer frameworks not rules.

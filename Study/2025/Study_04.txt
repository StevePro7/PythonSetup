How does a Software Engineer explain best practices to Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers to fetch and partition data in a performant and scalable way that would be consumed by thousands of clients?

CORE PRINCIPLES
1. Think in Terms of Load and Latency
thousands of clients - every data access impacts latency
use caching, data partitioning, async I/O

2. Move from "fetch-on-demand" to "prepare-ahead"
precompute or cache results
avoid fetch same data > 1


BEST PRACTICES
1. Fetch Smart: Cache, Paginate, and Stream
cache frequent queries	Redis or Memcached
paginate or stream	instead of loading large datasets - generators or async API
avoid repeated loads	share common service or API for data load

2. Partition for Scalability, Not Just Convenience
shard data		partition by userID, time, geography	parallel read/write
partitions consistent	chunk hash-based [num_buckets] or range-based
distributed file system	S3

3. Use Asynchronous and Parallel Techniques
async I/O	use async code to handle many requests efficiently
multiprocessing or distributed compute	CPU-heavy processing

4. Standardize Interfaces: APIs > Ad-hoc Scripts
well-versioned REST APIs
avoid each model = own data-fetch logic

5. Monitor, Profile, and Fail Gracefully
track data fetch latency, failures, throughput => Prometheus/Grafana
data load code has timeouts, retries, fallback e.g. return cached or default data

Communicating to DS/ML Teams
Partitioning	split class into smaller groups	each teacher [server] handles fewer students [data] = faster
Caching		keep recent results on your desk - don't go back to library every time
PARTITIONING
1. Partitioning at the Data Source (Recommended for Scale)
Where:	database, data warehouse or data storage system	S3
Why:	reduce data transfer, parallel reads [master/slave], indexing

2. Partitioning on Fetch (Common in App or ML Code)
Where:	Python	App or ML code
Why:	client control, no native data partitioning, stream processing, tasks queues, model pipelines

3. Partitioning During Storage/Preprocessing
Where:	ETL	data pipeline
Why:	future reads, fast, consistent, ML pipelines [dataset versioned and reused]
